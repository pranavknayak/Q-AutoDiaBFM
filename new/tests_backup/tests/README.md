## Illustrative examples of what each detector looks for

Contains example buggy-patched pairs for each detector. Half contain positive examples, that actually belong to the pattern, and the other half contain negative examples that do not belong to the pattern.

Patterns covered:
- `ExcessiveMeasurements`
- `IncorrectInitializations`
- `IncorrectMeasurements`
- `IncorrectOpaqueGates`
- `IncorrectHadamardGates`
- `IncorrectStandardGates`
- `UnequalBits`

The examples are meant to be illustrative, and contain only those constructs that are relevant to the detector.
